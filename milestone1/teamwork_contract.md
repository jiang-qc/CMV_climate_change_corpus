# Teamwork Contract
**Members: Qichao Jiang, Andrew Stich, Yuesheng Luo, Toshiko Shibano**

## Project Management

To ensure work progress throughout each week, each member will take on a project manager role as follows:

- Week 1: Toshiko
- Week 2: Qichao
- Week 3: Andrew
- Week 4: Yuesheng

## Work distribution

Each milestone task shall be assigned to one or more team members. Work shall be distributed such that each team member receives workload that is roughly equivalent to the same number of rubric points. That is, if the milestone of the week has rubric={accuracy:2,reasoning:2,writing:2,raw:2}, then each team member should receive workload that is roughly equivalent to 2 points.

## Quality of work, repo organization

1. REQUIRED: All members should never push directly to the master branch during the project. Instead, when one is ready to share their work, one should create a pull request to the master branch, which should be reviewed by one other member of the team.
2. All members shall be responsible for documenting their own code.
3. All members shall be responsible for citing their sources.
4. Source code and Jupyter Notebooks shall be stored in `src` folder.

## Checklists and minutes

At the first team meeting of the week, Toshiko will prepare Google Doc for the team as a checklist for the week, document the work distribution and meeting minutes. This Doc shall be submitted as part of the milestone deliverables every week.

## Meeting hours and frequency

Team meetings shall take place before 7pm PST, Monday-Friday. Aside from weekly meetings with the mentor, there shall be one team meeting on Mondays and other meetings as necessary.
