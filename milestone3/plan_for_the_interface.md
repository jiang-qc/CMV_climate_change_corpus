# Plan for the interface
The goal of this interface is to give the viewers an easy access of data in our copus and an informative visualization of annotated samples.
## Key functions
The user can search in the full corpus containing 792 reddit discussions. The user will be able to select for a keyword in a search box and click search, the interface will return the comments containing this keyword. It will also allow the user to select from a list of aspects (politics, humanity, science, economy) from a dropdown menu, as well as a list of opinions (concerned, not concerned, neutral, conflicted) from a dropdown menu. The interface will be displaying the corresponding sentences given the specified aspect and opinion. 
## Visulizations 
Aside from specific sentences, the interface will also show several visualization graphs. It will show a pie graph for the distribution of delta comments among the corresponding sentences. There will be two bar graphs, one for the number of sentences for each aspect and another one for the number of sentences for each opinion.  In addition, there will be a wordcloud for the most frequent keywords in the corresponding sentences.
