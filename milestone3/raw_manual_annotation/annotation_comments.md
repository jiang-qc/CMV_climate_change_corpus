# Annotation Comments

## Measures taken to improve agreement

Each of the four groupmates annotated the same ten random documents as a trial to see what difficulties might be encountered. The following difficulties were revealed by this exercise:

- Not all sentences could be categorized as neutral, concerned, or not concerned about climate change. Some commenters appeared conflicted about the usefulness of or the need for a measure to combat climate change, and provided reasons for or against. Most often, there was an implied worry about the dangers of climate change, meaning "Neutral" would not have been an appropriate annotation, but it seemed incorrect to classify such documents as "Concerned" alongside those documents whose main purpose was to express concern or to advocate for solutions. Therefore, we decided to add a new category, "Conflicted", to our original annotation guidelines to capture such cases.

- It turned out to be difficult to determine how related to the sentence our aspects (politics, humanity, science, and economy) had to be to be considered as "touched on". For instance, there were many sentences that essentially called for something to be done about corporations with harmful environmental practices, with the implied "doer" being the government, but without the government being mentioned explicitly. Should "Politics" be selected in such a case? It was impossible to address this problem fully in our guidelines, but we decided to err on the side of selecting fewer rather than more aspects per sentence, and in general to give higher weight to aspects whose semantic role (explicit or implied) was that of agent.

## Other difficulties encountered during annotation

- Our aspect "Humanity" was unlike the others in that many of the keywords used to find "Humanity" sentences referred to the masses in a passive capacity, e.g., the idea that people will be displaced or society will break down when climate change progresses past a certain point. However, there also turned out to be many sentences where "humanity" was cast in the role of consumer and given agency, e.g., the idea that climate change is not the fault of corporations but of ignorant and selfish people who refuse to compromise on living standards. This ambiguity made annotation more difficult and may also have caused our results to be less useful in that one of our labels was a chimera.

- A few of the sentences had no obvious relation to climate change (out of context). Our annotation guideline did not account for such sentences, which was problematic when they touched on one or more of our aspects.

- There were a few possible cases of sarcasm where a judgment call had to be made. Besides being hard to identify with certainty, our annotation guideline did not account for such sentences.

- Even with the new sentiment category "Conflicted", there were still many cases with ambiguous sentiment. For example, our annotation guideline determined that a sentence should be annotated as "Conflicted" when it mainly served to enumerate the pros and cons of some measure to combat climate change, but the discourse role of such sentences often appeared to be to advocate for a measure. It was not possible to write explicit rules to solve this problem in our annotation guideline, because the strength of this implied advocacy varied considerably from sentence to sentence, so that we had to rely on judgment.
