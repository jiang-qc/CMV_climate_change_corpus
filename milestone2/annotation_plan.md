# Annotation Plan #

## Kind of Annotation ##
We will annotate sentences about climate change from from the Change My View subreddit. Each sentence will concern UP TO four sub-topics related to climate change: Industry/Consumers/Government/Academia/None. If the sentence does not touch on a sub-topic, the annotators then need to tag whether the commentor is "Concerned about climate change"/"Not concerned about climate change"/"Neutral". Refer to the [Annotation Guidelines](https://github.ubc.ca/tshibano/COLX_523_Group7/blob/master/milestone2/annotation_guidelines.md) for details.

## Annotation Tool ##
Mechanical Turk

## Pilot Study ##
We will be using MTurk to annotate. To ensure the quality of annotation, the annotators have to be **High School Graduates** to correctly understand the sentences from reddit. We submiited a sample to test if our annotation guidlines are understandable. The average price for each annotation is **8.5 cents/example** (fees to Mechanical Turk included). It turned out there were 7 valid responses within 16 hours, which indicate our task is understandable and the price is reasonable. Most of the annotations are None and some are incorrect. According this, we improved our scraper and cleaned the data to make it better structured and easier to annotate.
 
## Expectation ##
Next week, we will submit the improved text data to Mturk and let aound 5 workers to annotate 500 examples.
